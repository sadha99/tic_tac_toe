# tic_tac_toe
A basic version of tic_tac_toe where the player gets assigned "X" by default and the computer gets assigned "O" 

The tic tac toe is a 3x3 board and we use 0-8 to represent the squares of the board.

The player will have to select a number from 0-8 to make a move and the computer selects a random choice from the list of available moves.

After every move made(both from player and computer) we check if there is a winner by checking the row ,column and diagnal of the most recently made move.

If there is a winner , we stop the game and print the letter ("X" or "O") to declare the winner.

We continue the game untill we get a winner or until all the squares run out ( this wil result in a tie)
